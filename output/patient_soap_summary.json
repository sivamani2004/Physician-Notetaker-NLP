She was wearing her seatbelt. Immediately after the impact, she hit her head on the steering wheel and experienced pain in her neck and back. She sought medical attention at Moss Bank Accident and Emergency, where she was diagnosed with a whiplash injury and advised to go home without X-rays. The first four weeks post-accident were marked by severe neck and back pain, difficulty sleeping, and regular painkiller use. She subsequently completed ten sessions of physiotherapy. Currently, she experiences occasional backaches, which are significantly less severe than before. She denies anxiety while driving, difficulty concentrating, or any emotional issues related to the accident. She took one week off work but reports no ongoing impact on her work or daily life."
